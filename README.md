This is just slides from the short talk I did at an internal Dev meeting. You can run the notebook by installing the newest version of Jupyter and then installing the clojure kernel from https://github.com/roryk/clojupyter. Just run `jupyter-notebook --kernel=clojure` and things should be ok. You might have to tell the notebook to restart the kernel once at the start, for some reason it wouldn't start correctly the first time for me but a restart made everything ok. Also, note that the Riemann code slides don't compile, since the riemann functions in there (streams, where, etc.) don't exist in the notebook namespace.
